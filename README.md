# WiDS-Camouflage-Object-Masking
This project was completed as a part of Winter in Data Science 2022.

Camouflage Object Masking deals with the task of identifying and segmenting out objects that are not well-distinguished from their backgrounds. This is a specialized problem within the domain of Computer Vision, which has been seeing and continues to see rapid advances and novel techniques.

Camouflage Object Masking has several applications across varied fields including medical image segementation, rare species discovery, the miliary, and so on. Recent work also suggests that research in AI-based segmentation of camouflaged objects could hold key insights into how the hierarchial levels of human visual perception are structured.

Throughout this project, PyTorch has mainly been used as the framework. I have used the final dataset as given. Please change the paths of files accordingly while running the code to test the model.
